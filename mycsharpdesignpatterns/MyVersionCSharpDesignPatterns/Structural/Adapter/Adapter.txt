#Adapter
- Getting the interface you want from the interface you have.
- A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

##Motivation
- We need some interface but we don't modify our existent interfaces.

##Summary
- Determine the API you have and the API you need;
- Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to) the adaptee;
- Intermediate representations can pile up: user caching and other optimizations.

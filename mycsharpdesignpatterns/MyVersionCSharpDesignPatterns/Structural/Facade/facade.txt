#Facade
- Exposing several components through a single interface.
- Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

##Motivation
- Balancing complexity and presentation/usability;
- Many subsystems;
- Complex internal structure;
- End user is not exposed to internals.

##Summary
- Build a facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes;
- May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade;
- May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if they need to.

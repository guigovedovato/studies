#Brigde
- Connecting components together through abstractions.
- A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy).

##Motivation
- Bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion;
- Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion.

##Summary
- Decouple abstraction from implementation;
- Both can exist as hierarchies;
- A stronger form of encapsulation.

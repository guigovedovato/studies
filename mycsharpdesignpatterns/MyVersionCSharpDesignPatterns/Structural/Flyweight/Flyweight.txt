#Flyweight
- Space optimization.
- A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

##Motivation
- Avoid redundancy when storing data.

##Summary
- Store common data externally;
- Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges.

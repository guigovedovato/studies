#Proxy
- An interface for accessing a particular resource.
- A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct,
or may require logging or some other added functionality.

##Motivation
- Access operations in separated proccess;
- Objects with same interface, entirely different behaviours.

##Summary
- A proxy has the same interface as the underlying object;
- To create a proxy, simply replicate the existing interface of an object;
- Add relevant functionality to the redefined member functions;
- Different proxies have completely different behavipurs.

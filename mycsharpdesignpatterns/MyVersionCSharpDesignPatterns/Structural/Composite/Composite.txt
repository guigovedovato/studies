#Composite
- Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformly.
- A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.

##Motivation
- Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition.

##Summary
- Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition;
- Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviours;
- Composite design pattern let us treat both type of objects uniformly;
- A single object can masquerade as a collection with yield return this.

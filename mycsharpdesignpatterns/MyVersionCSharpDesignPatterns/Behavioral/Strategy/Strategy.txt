#Strategy
- System behaviour partially specified at runtime.
- Enables the exact behaviour of a system to be selected either at run-time or compile-time.
- Also Known as a policy.

##Motivation
- Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts;

##Summary
- Define an algorithm at a hight level;
- Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow;
- Provide for either dynamic or static composition of strategy in the overall algorithm.

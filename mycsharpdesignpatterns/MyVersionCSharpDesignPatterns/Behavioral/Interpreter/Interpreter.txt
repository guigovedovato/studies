#Interpreter
- Interpreters are all around us. Even now, in this very room.
- A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separated lexical tokens
(lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).

##Motivation
- Textual input needs to be processed

##Summary
- Barring simple cases, an interpreter acts in two stages
 - Lexing turns text into a set of tokens;
 - Parsing tokens into meaningful constructors.
- Parsed data can then be traversed.

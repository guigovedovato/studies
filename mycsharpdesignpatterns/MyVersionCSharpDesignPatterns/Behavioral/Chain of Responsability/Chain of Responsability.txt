#Chain of Responsability
- Sequence of handlers processing an event one after another.
- A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, 
optionally having default processing implementation and an ability to terminate the processing chain.

##Motivation
- Many actions depends on the first action.

##Summary
- Chain of responsability can be implemented as a chain of references or a centralized construct;
- Enlist objects in the chain, possibly controlling their order;
- Object removal from chain.

#Mediator
- Facilitates communication between components.
- A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarely being aware 
of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other.

##Motivation
- Components may go in and out of a system at any time:
 - Chat room participants;
 - Players in a MMORPG.
- It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another:
 - Those referenses may go dead.
- Solution: have then all refer to some central component that facilitates communication.

##Summary
- Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it;
- Mediator engages in bidiretional communication with its connected component;
- Mediator has functions the component can call;
- Components have functions the mediator can call;
- Event processing libraries make communication easier to implement.

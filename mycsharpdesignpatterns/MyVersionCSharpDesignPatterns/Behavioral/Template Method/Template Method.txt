#Template Method
- A high-level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inherithors.
- Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations defined in subclasses.

##Motivation
- Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts + specifics;
- Strategy pattern does this through composition:
 - High-level algorithm uses an interface;
 - Concrete implementations implement the interface.
- Template Method does the same thing through inheritance:
 - Overall algorithm makes use of abstract method;
 - Inheritors override the abstract members;
 - Parent template method invoked.

##Summary
- Define an algorithm at a high level;
- Define constituent parts as abstract methods/properties;
- Inherit the algorithm class, providing necessary overrides.

#Command
- You shall not pass!
- An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary
for the action to be taken.

##Motivation
- Ordinary statements are perishable:
 - cannot undo a field/property assignment;
 - cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls).
- Want an object that represents an operation
 - x should change its propert y to z;
 - x should do w().
- Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording, etc...

##Summary
- Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object;
- Define instructions for applying the command (either in the command itself or elsewhere)
- Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
- Can create composite commands

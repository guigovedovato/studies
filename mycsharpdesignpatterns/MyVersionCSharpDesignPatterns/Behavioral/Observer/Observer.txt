#Observer
- Built-in right into C#/.Net, right?
- An observer is an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system.
The entity generating the events is an observable.

##Motivation
- We need to be informed when certain things happen;
- We want to listen to events and notified when they occur.

##Summary
- Observer is an intrusive approach: an observable must provide an event to subscribe to;
- Special care must be taken to prevent issues in multithreaded scenarios;
- .NET comes with observable collections;
- IObserver<T>/IObservable<T> are used in stream processing (Reactive Extensions).
